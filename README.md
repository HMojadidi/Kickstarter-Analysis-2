# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Based on the Kickstarter data, Louisa's initial question was pertaining to theatre fundraisers within the US and underlying trends.

In the US alone, there were 912 theater fundraisers of which:

* 525 were successful
* 349 had failed
* 26 got cancelled
* 12 are still ongoing

Insights:

* The failed campaigns had higher fundraising goals than the successful campaigns.
* Since Louisa was asking for more than twice the average successful kickstarter goal, this would not be beneficial for her campaign. It would be best to keep her campaign goal at a lower budget. 
* May and June had seen the more successful Kickstarter launch campaigns.
* Roughly a similar number of failed campaigns were launched in January, June, July and October.
* Statistical analysis revealed that the some failed campaigns had really high goals.
* Statisitcal analysis of successful and failed goals and pledges generally show the the standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everyting below the mean is considered rather close to the center and indicative of the data distribution pattern.

Louisa was also interested in the possibility of running a fundraiser of about $4000 for a musical in the U.K. and my analysis closely studied the 5 plays that she was particularly interested in learning about.

Insights:

The budgets of these play fell $4000 and below, with average contributions roughly ranging from $33 - $51 per backer. She would increase her chances of getting funding by lowering her budget for that campaign as well.
